A website for a company that provides the service of piano tuning. It is all about simplicity and neatness.
Pianossi encourages people with pianos at home to apply for a piano tuning session just with a simple form signup.

The main core for this website is a color palette with pure warmth and calmness with easy-to-reach top navigation and footer.
My aim is to communicate what piano playing is all about - life enjoyment in the sipmplest of ways.


## Navigation

![Navigation bar](/assets/images/pianossi1.jpg)

A solid dark piano color with easy accesible navigation bar that is responsive to different screen sizes.

From here you can reach all the pages within the website on clear links with background changing upon hovering over. Also a clear visible active indicator to show what page you are currently viewing.

## Main section

Through the three pages, information is provided to the user with a consistent layout, three different images but with the exact same size will be very pleasant for the eye.
In the modern days we tend to be stressed and busy with our everyday life. That is why this website will only provide with the clearest information and lets the user emphasise on the task that needs to get done - have someone tune their piano for them.

## Credits

### Media
For the media query part I have searched for the information on W3Schools Online Web Tutorials.

### Content
What has been very useful in my work is to go back and browse the study material and challenges that I have finished in HTML/CSS essentials modules. 

I have learned one very IMPORTANT thing to remember since I started this course: Get going - and no matter what you do, keep on going.
