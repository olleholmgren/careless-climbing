# Pianossi


A website for a company that provides the service of piano tuning. It is all about simplicity and neatness.
Pianossi encourages people with pianos at home to apply for a piano tuning session just with a simple form signup.

The main core for this website is a color palette with pure warmth and calmness with easy-to-reach top navigation and footer.
My aim is to communicate what piano playing is all about - life enjoyment in the sipmplest of ways.


## Navigation

![nav-image](/assets/images/nav-shot.png)

An easy accesible navigation bar in solid black and ivory piano color that is responsive to different screen sizes.

From here you can reach all the pages within the website on clear links with background changing upon hovering over. Also a clear visible active indicator to show what page you are currently viewing.


## Main section

Through the three pages, information is provided to the user with a consistent layout, three different images but with the exact same size that will make the whole user experience easy-going and also very pleasant for the eye.

In the modern days we tend to be stressed and busy with our everyday life. That is why this website will only provide with the clearest information and lets the user emphasise on the task that needs to get done - have someone tune their piano for them.

### Design

The design is supposed to give the feeling that one have come to a calm and relaxed platform. After all the purpose of the site is to provide service to piano owners. Many people associate calmness and simplicity with a piano - one press on a key and it will instantly play a sound, effortless.
Color theme is chosen with this feeling in mind. The navigation bar with the same colors as the keys on a piano.
Background is a calm greenish beige color and the footer along with the contact form is to match with these colors and feelings.

### Home page

An easy-to-view, clear and simple section welcoming the user to this exquisite webpage.

Here one can also see the red color that appears when hovering with the cursor over a certain button in the navigation bar.

### Media

This entire webpage is 100% fully responsive to all different screen sizes whether it is a desktop computer, tablet or smart phone.

For the media query part I have searched for and used the material provided on W3Schools Online Web Tutorials https://www.w3schools.com

The photos used on the home, about and contact page are from the site https://unsplash.com

### Content

What has been very useful in my work is to go back and browse the study material and challenges that I have finished in Code Institute HTML/CSS essentials modules and I am glad that i finished all assignments and challenges in order to conquer the core knowledge of all basics in HTML and CSS as well as the use of Github, Gitpod and last but not least. the well-used command line in Gitpod. 


## Testing

Through the entire path of making this webpage, I have thoroughly tested all of the content in different ways, for example cmd+s in Gitpod then straight to the browser and press cmd+shft+r to see that all of my HTML code runs in the way i want to and CSS to give the correct styling.

Testing of the responsiveness has been done by opening the Google Dev Tools 'inspect' function in the Chrome browser, and then dragged the side list in order to see that it is responsive in all preferred screen sizes.

I have also used Chrome dev tools to carry out Lighthouse tests on each page with the results as below:

### Index page Lighthouse test result

### Contact page Lighthouse test result

## Validation

## Deployment
In the end, I deployed my webpage to GitHub.com.
- First, I made sure that I have made all my 'git add .' and 'git commit -s'.
- Then I went over to my repository in GitHub, navigated to 'Settings' -> 'Pages'.
- In 'Pages', under the 'Source' section I deployed my page from the 'main branch'.

## Last few words
A big, warm THANK YOU goes to my excellent mentor Spencer Bariball at Code Institute.

On this first month with Code Institute I have learned one very IMPORTANT thing to always keep in mind:
Get going - and no matter what you do, keep on coding...

keep on coding...

keep on coding...
