Pianossi

A website for a company that provides the service of piano tuning. It is all about simplicity and neatness.
Pianossi encourages people with pianos at home to apply for a piano tuning session just with a simple form signup.

The main core for this website is a color palette with pure warmth and calmness with easy-to-reach top navigation and footer.
My aim is to communicate what piano playing is all about - life enjoyment in the sipmplest of ways.
